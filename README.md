# Roman Senate: A Blockchain Governance Model

## Overview

The Roman Senate governance model is a blockchain-based system designed to recreate the structure of the Roman Senate. It's built on the Ethereum network using Smart Contracts to implement a complex voting system that includes Consuls, Censors, Dictators, Senators, and Tribunes.

This governance model features two contracts, `SenatePositions` and `Senate`, which define the roles and responsibilities of the Senate members and facilitate the creation and voting on proposals.

## Contracts

### SenatePositions Contract

The `SenatePositions` contract is used to manage Senate member positions. It enables certain administrative functionalities such as appointing and removing Senate members to and from various positions such as Consul, Censor, Dictator, Senator, and Tribune.

Each of these positions has its own specific permissions and requirements in the Senate governance model.

The contract includes several key methods including `appointPosition`, `removePosition`, and `validatePosition` that aid in managing the members of the Senate.

### Senate Contract

The `Senate` contract is the heart of the governance model. It handles all the legislative actions including creation, voting, and execution of proposals. It uses the `SenatePositions` contract to verify the validity of a user's position and ensure the appropriate permissions are upheld.

Some of the key methods include `createProposal`, `castVote`, `executeProposal`, `validatePosition`, and `updateSenatePositionsContract`.

The `Senate` contract is also capable of updating the `SenatePositions` contract's address via `updateSenatePositionsContract`, which ensures the system can adapt to potential changes in the contract's location.

### House Contract

The `House` contract serves as the staking contract for the `xTIDE` ERC20 token and also facilitates token-based governance proposals that, if passed, may be passed onto the Senate for execution voting (so long as the Tribune wants to submit it). Any user who stakes enough `xTIDE` tokens becomes a member of the House and is able to vote on proposals.

The key functionalities of the `House` contract include token staking, unstaking, and voting on proposals. Standard ERC20 voting mechanics are employed, allowing users to vote on proposals proportional to their staked token balance.

The contract also maintains a registry of all current House members and their staked token balances, ensuring a transparent and democratic voting system.


## Usage

To interact with the contracts, users can call the various methods implemented in the `Senate` and `SenatePositions` contracts.

For example, creating a new proposal would involve calling the `createProposal` method in the `Senate` contract, passing in the necessary parameters.

To validate the position of a user, the `validatePosition` method in the `SenatePositions` contract can be called.

## Security

The contracts have been designed with a high emphasis on security. Many of the key functions can only be called by certain positions or require certain conditions to be met before they can be executed. For instance, updating the address of the `SenatePositions` contract can only be done through a Senate proposal.

## Conclusion

The Roman Senate governance model is a robust and flexible system for implementing a structured, democratic decision-making process on the Ethereum blockchain. It's highly customizable and can be adapted to fit a wide variety of applications.
